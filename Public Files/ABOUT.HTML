    </center>
    <p><h3> My Name is Robert Terry. I am a harding working, quick on my feet, lively, and energetic person. I am currently taking a course to become a Certified Web Developer instructed by Dr. Angela Wu of the <em>App Brewery</em>, with this knowledge and certification I hope to venture into the Web Designer/Developer career field.</h3></p>
    <h3><p>I see myself in the next 2-5 years developing websites on my own time while finding a company I can call home and continue to develop my skills as a developer  and further expand on my capabilities. I want to find somewhere where everyone I meet can teach me or give me a skill so I can always improve as a person and a Web/App developer. </p></h3>
